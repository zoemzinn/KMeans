Compress an image by reducing its number of colors using KMeans clustering. This program requires three arguments and can be run in the terminal as such:

    python imgCompKMeans.py --imageFileName <filename> --k <number of clusters> --outputFileName <filename>

Where the input filename is the name of the picture to be compressed and the output filename denotes the location of the newly compressed image. The number of clusters represents the number of colors present in the image after compression.
